# Facial Emotion Recognition

Emotion recognition of a human face from a photo/video frame is widely used in consumer industry and other industries to gauge human behavior, attentiveness and analyze the emotion. In our project, we worked on building a model that could predict emotion on the human face. Trained model is integrated into a website where the human face is captured from a webcam video feed and live emotion detection is captured.
